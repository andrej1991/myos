Infromation about the memory returned by INT 0x15 (function 0xE820) is stored in an array beginig at 0x40104. The size of the array is in a 32 bit integer at position 0x40100.
The kernel is loaded to the address 0x100000.
After the kernel the GDT is loaded. The size of the kernel is adjusted to 4KB boundary.
GDT is folowed by the IDT.
After the IDT the kernel data is loaded.
The kernel stack is started at 0x40000.
